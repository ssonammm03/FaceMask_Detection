# FaceMask_Detection
Why did you choose this topic?
    
I selected this topic because face mask detection is an important application of deep learning in our world today. COVID-19 pandemic period and post-pandemic era witnessed a typical practice for public health, which is to wear face masks to prevent the spread of airborne diseases. Making sure people are wearing masks properly – even in public places such as schools, hospitals, and buses – can encourage health and safety. I wanted to investigate the application of AI and computer vision to support such practices by means of automation and monitoring.

What are the benefits of this topic in terms of developing your deep learning skills?

This project enables me to apply deep learning approaches to solve a problem in the real world. I was able to learn and practice:

•	Preprocessing of image and augmentation of data to obtain better training results. 

•	Designing and training CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) with TensorFlow/Keras library. 

•	Perform evaluation of the model with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and confusion matrix. 

•	Real time deployment with use of webcam input which can be useful in monitoring tools. It also allowed me to know how AI can be used in public safety applications.

What are the expected outcomes of the project?
   
•	Trained deep learning model that will be able to determine if a person is wearing a mask. 

•	An application that is live and uses webcam input or uploaded images in detecting. 

•	The capacity for correct classification of two groups: “Mask” and “No Mask.” 

•	The ability to extend to a third class “Incorrect Mask Use,” or detecting more than one person simultaneously in the future.

Aims and Objectives

To create a CNN model that will help classify people wearing and not wearing a mask. 

•	To gain control of the complete process of image classification from data handling to model deployment. 

•	To measure and improve the performance of the model.

•	To develop a real time system that would act as a point of support to health and safety in public places.


Scope of the project
   
The project has a job of a three-class classification task: determining if a person is wearing a mask correctly, if he is not wearing a mask, or has put on an incorrect mask. It is tested with static images.

Limitations: 

•	May work poorly in low-light and when face is occluded partially. 

•	For now, only capable of single-faced detection and is not real-time detection in crowded scenes.

In the future, the system can be made better by using the best object detection model, YOLO to support the multiple face detection and the real-time application.

Conclusion

This project showed the capability of deep learning in generating a face mask detection system for the sake of public healthcare and safety. To gain practical experience in classification of images, model testing and the practical implementation in real time, I learned the use of computer vision methods. The system can track masks in public places and (in the future) cope with more complicated situations. Overall, the project trained me technically to solve a real practical problem.
